![Jose Arcadio Buendía ties to a tree](https://occ-0-8407-92.1.nflxso.net/dnm/api/v6/E8vDc_W8CLv7-yMQu8KMEC7Rrr8/AAAABV7-GfYz-XTvE104LXCUEQIZ4rWM29_w9uxm0440ZqEObEeWyOujn2OBKnA7pZkJchTCPHpu55rCvrSBH8rl1CRcSZxBI2tKeTUl.jpg)

“Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” This is the first sentence from my favorite novel, “One Hundred Years of Solitude” by Gabriel García Márquez. I first read this novel when my sister studied it in 11th grade, and since then, it has become my favorite book. I reread it each year and always find something new within its rich philosophical and mythological themes. I don’t need any charts to remember all of its Aurelianos and José Arcadios because I have read it so many times that the characters are firmly etched in my mind. So, what is it about this novel that draws me back year after year? Why can’t I stop reading it? The answer is both simple and complex. 

The story's seemingly straightforward structure carries on the family novel tradition.The history of six generations of the same family is described in detail, including its birth, flowering, stability of family features and fate, decline, and death. It is an epic, slow-paced novel that is rich in details, descriptions, numbers, and facts. So essential, so grounded, so real. One hundred years seems to encompass the entire universe's life cycle, including its creation, growth, and demise. It's as if one full cycle has passed, the next spiral has ended, and every time we start reading this book, we move on to a new spiral and experience a new cycle in the universe. Is it really so profound, after all?  Here, there are no incomprehensible declarations from heroes, the pursuit of life's purpose, philosophical contemplations, elderly women slain by an axe, etc… Everything is as it is in our life - simple, real, everyday. Beauty and wisdom in simplicity…

In a confined and constrained area, Márquez recreates the integrity of reality and the world. A fictional geographical location with accurate temporal references to Colombia's history between the 1840s and 1930s is expertly woven into the imaginary realm with echoes of actual occurrences. Fiction is entangled with reality. The same names, the same situations, events, and destinies, the same loneliness—all of these things are repeated endlessly, like the story of our lives. 

“Lonely he goes, lonely he comes, and therefore is called «the living alone». Nothing in the world is more valuable than man in his solitary existence. " In the fourth century BC, the Chinese philosopher Jun-zi (Jun Zhou) made this statement, which the renowned philosopher Márquez reiterated in the twentieth century.

Marquez weaves together and enhances two dimensions: ordinary and fantastic-mythological, real-concrete and literary-booklike. And this combination of two different dimensions creates the duality of Marquez's heroes. We perceive them as flawed, morally ambiguous, and unable to experience profound emotions. However, this is just an initial impression.

Buendía, which translates as "hello" in Spanish, has a profound meaning. It seems to imply that we cannot and will not be able to get to know Buendía after the initial greeting of the first interaction. You must take away all the layers that life puts on them in order to view them for who they truly are. Through all of these layers, you can see that they are capable of love, fear, and friendship, but they are also incredibly alone and ununderstood by others. A hundred years, a thousand years, and millions of years are all like a single moment. "We come and go, and each moment brings thousands to Earth and takes thousands away;  Earth is a haven for strangers, a wandering star on which the captive bird stops and from which it flies" says Johann Gottfried Herder, and Marquez adds "...because the races condemned to a hundred years of solitude had no second chance on earth."
