A small cubic die is so popular in board games, but what is its origin? Where did it come from and how was it used during its long human history? Let’s try to find out.

A traditional dice is a small cube, typically measuring 1.6 cm on each side. Each side is numbered from one to six and marked with round dots known as pips. The sum of the numbers on opposite sides of a die adds up to seven. Faces 1,2 and 3 share a common vertex and can be arranged either clockwise or counterclockwise around this vertex. If faces 1, 2, and 3 are positioned in a counterclockwise direction, the die is referred to as a right cube. Conversely, if they are arranged clockwise, it is considered a left cube. 

Typically, Western dice are right-handed, while Chinese dice are left-handed. Rounded angles are not accidental. The cube acquires a semi-spherical shape, and the surface sliding increases while the die rolls like a ball. The probability of falling out of certain numbers becomes uniform: the influence of the initial position of the cube and the nature of the movement during the throw becomes negligibly small.

The historical study of dices relies on archaeological material however these studies often provide incomplete information about how and where the dices were used. This is due to perishable nature of material, which was used in making these artifacts. Cubic dice have been made of bones, stone, wood and clay and have been in use since the third millennium BCE. One of the earliest example of dice is the dice from the settlement Tepe Gawra (northwestern Iraq), which has the numbers 1-6, 2-4, and 3-5.

Archaeological analysis has shown that dice can serve as chronological markers. Some of dice feature the Greek letters on its faces and a paleographic analysis has dated these gaming artifacts to the second century BCE, coinciding with the end of the Hellenistic period in Egypt. This knowledge helped in dating the El-Hesa skeletal material in Egypt.

Dice came to Europe, probably from Asia. The invention of dice is sometimes attributed to the Lydians, Egyptians, or Greeks (specifically, Palamedes). In Greece, dice were used for both divination and gaming, and they were classified into cubes (κύβοι, tesserae) and astragali (άστραγάλοι, άστριες, άστριχιοί, tali). The cubes resembled modern six-sided dice, which have pips numbered from one to six. They were used for gaming: άρτιασμός - where players would bet on odd or even outcomes based on the number rolled, τρόπα — which required players to throw the die into a hole drilled in a board; ώμιλλα — where players would throw dice into a drawn circle. 

Astragalus was played in πλειστοβολίνθα: players assigned a certain a amount of money to each point; after everyone took their turn throwing the die, the player with the highest total points won. It is said that Iberius practiced fortune-telling by throwing golden astragalus into the water. In the small oracle of Hercules, located in the Achaean city of Bura, answers were received by casting astragalus onto a special tablet inscribed with advice and wise sayings from everyday life. 

In the 10th century A.D., Wiebold, the Bishop of Cambria, sought to discourage monks from gambling, which had become rampant in society at that time. To achieve this, he devised a new game called "ludus regularis" or "ludus clericalis." In this game, the points earned from rolling three dice corresponded to the names of various virtues, such as Caritas (Charity), Fides (Faith), and Castitas (Chastity). The monks, who excelled in this game, were intended to guide other players toward virtuous behavior. 

Henry II of England banned the dice game for Crusaders in 1188. Medieval literature is full of mourning for the destruction of the dice game, which affected not only knights but townspeople and even the people. 

The role of dice game changed at the end of the Middle Ages, around 1300 to 1500 CE. Cards games became popular in the second half of XIV century. In XV century it spread from Italy and France to other regions and all layers of society. Since cards could be used for strategy games as well as gambling, they gained popularity over dice. Additionally, in the fifteenth century, Europe witnessed the development of lotteries, which reached the Low Countries around 1440. This implies that approximately 1450 CE, dice were no longer the main gambling element and medieval game-playing entered a new age.

Alex de Voogt and Jelmer W. Eerkens studied 110 different dice in their research titled “The Evolution of Cubic Dice: From the Roman Through the Post-Medieval Period in the Netherlands.” They noted that cubes made before 400 AD (prior to the adoption of Christianity in parts of Holland) exhibit significant variation in size, shape, pip placement, and materials. There are very few findings from the following 700 years, a period marked by the barbarian plundering of the Roman Empire. 

Starting from 1100 AD, the dice examples discovered show a configuration based on "prime numbers," where the opposite faces correspond to prime numbers (1-2, 3-4, 5-6). This style of numbering was also popular in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. Additionally, the cubes from the early Middle Ages are notably smaller than their Roman predecessors. 

From the mid-15th century onward, the numbering system shifted to a "sevens" configuration, where the opposite sides add up to seven points. During this period, the dice became more uniform in shape and increased in size. This ideal shape may have been influenced by mass production methods, as steel manufacturers ensured that their products adhered to standard sizes and shapes. 

They also mentioned that the design of dice labels has evolved over time. In the Roman era, the labels featured two circles with a dot in the center. During the Middle Ages, this changed to a single circle with a dot, and eventually, modern dice adopted just a dot as the label. The placement of the marks follows a principle where the sum of the points on opposite sides equals seven. While this does not make the game flawless, it does create balanced odds for rolling both low and high values. As the exact sciences advanced, people began to realize that the outcomes of the game are not controlled by higher forces.
